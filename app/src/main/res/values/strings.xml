    <string name="info_desc">Welcome to the ABC challenge This is a full body workout designed to improve your strength, muscular endurance and anaerobic capacity. It is composed of an array of movements of different difficulties that will push your current level of fitness through the stratosphere.
        \n \n
        The aim of the challenge is to get through as many of the exercises as possible. This may not be difficult for some of you; in this case there is a rep challenge in which you either complete 10 or 5 reps of each exercise. You also have the option to time yourself so you know if your fitness has increased as your time should decrease, providing you practice the movements enough.
        \n \n
        Most of the exercises have options which either increase or decrease the difficulty of the exercises so you may be challenged optimally. Make sure you set a plan in your head of the exercises you will be attempting to prevent early fatigue or under stimulation.
        \n \n
        Record your name and the letter in which you made it to, or the amount of reps completed of each letter in the space provided, there is an optional time column to complete if you wish to race against the clock.
        \n \n
        Each single sided exercise must be performed on each side to count as one rep. These exercises are Russian twist, Lunge and Mountain Climbers.
        \n \n
        Remember, if you are someone who shies away from a challenge because you don\'t like comparing yourself to others, it\'s an individual pursuit and the most important person you should be competing against is yourself. So give it a go, surprise yourself and take something away from this challenge.
        \n \n
        Special thanks to all our awesome models for their great demonstrations!
        \n \n
        If you have any questions about the challenge don\'t hesitate to ask our friendly Club Aqua staff as they will be more than happy to assist you.
        \n \n
        <b>Good Luck!</b>
